I defended my dissertation on 18 December 2018, and we moved out of our apartment five days later. We flew across the country to Columbus, Ohio, and then to Boston. 7 January 2019 was my first day as a machine learning scientist at Generate Biomedicines, then known as VL57. Next Monday, on 27 April 2020, I'll be moving on to Microsoft Research (MSR). I've been explaining to people that MSR better fits what I want to do long-term in my career, and here I'm going to expand and clarify that. 

## What I want to do in my work

Through my time teaching, in my PhD, and time at Generate, I've distilled what I want from my work to three goals: 

### Discover and learn new science

I want to pursue research directions that are interesting to me and have the potential for broader societal impacts. Right now, machine learning, biology, and to some extent social science interest me. In my PhD and at Generate, I focused on applying machine learning to proteins. I'm still interested in that, but I'd also like to broaden my research scope. I'd like intellectual ownership of this research agenda: if I move jobs, I'd like to be able to take my work with me and talk about it.

Conversely, I am not interested in developing products,  or thinking about business questions. 

### Tell people about them

I strongly believe that dissemination is an essential part of science. This includes: 

- Publications
- Talks
- Teaching
- Conferences
- Other writing

Ideally, I would like to do this without having to ask lawyers or a board for permission

### Help other people discover new things 

mentoring, reviewing

What I don't want to do

## Thoughts on biotech and Flagship Startups

Ownership

so a flagship type startup is great if you want to do biotech science

meaning: working in largish teams to create products / convince people to give your company money

I'm not really interested in the downstream product development

and one of my career goals is to never have to think about business questions

I also think the need to make money in the medium term really constrains what you can work on

as does the underlying philosophy that makes money for investors = creates value in the world

I also want to be somewhere where it's easier to disseminate my work externally and participate in the global research community

where things like publishing, giving talks, teaching, reviewing papers, mentoring postdocs, etc are both easy to do and rewarded

I was really frustrated with having to ask multiple execs and lawyers for permission to publish and handwringing about whether we should publish and IP and months-long leadtimes

I thought about applying for academic jobs, but trying to get tenure with a toddler seemed really hard

and honestly unfair to my wife for the amount of single-parenting I'd be making her doing
