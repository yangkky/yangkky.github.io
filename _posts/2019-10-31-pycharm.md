## Introduction
What is pycharm
Why use an IDE?
## What I want
Geared towards ML
Run code in a remote instance for prototyping
Remote instance ideally has stable IP
Sync between local and remote
Run on remote for training


## Setting up an SSH config
So that we don't have to remember where the key is
<example>
## Setting a remote interpreter
<pictures, step by step>
Can set up more interpreters
Better than prototyping in notebook
key commands for running lines of code 
## Syncing files
SCP = sad
Automatically set up 
Can set up more remotes
<pictures for setting up more remotes>
Automatic or manual
Can also download
## tmux for long-running jobs
Don't want training to die when ssh breaks
Tmux commands: new session, attach/detach, split window, close window, scroll up
