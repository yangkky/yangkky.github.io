I'm a computational biologist working at the intersection of machine learning and biology. I'm especially interested in models for biological sequences such as proteins and nucleic acids. Currently, I'm a graduate student at Caltech.

Here's some more background [about me](/about) and details about [my research](/research). My resume can be found [here](https://github.com/yangkky/resume/blob/master/KKY_cv.pdf).

### Research

Machine learning is the science of getting computers to learn from data instead of being explicitly programmed. In the past decade, machine learning has given us machine translation, self-driving cars, and effective web search. As DNA-sequencing and synthesis technology improves, humanity is amassing a vast collection of biological sequence data. Machine learning will be a vital approach for understanding and using this data.

My PhD research uses machine learning to attack challenges in protein engineering that are otherwise intractable because they are both too complex to be designed from first principles and not amenable to the high-throughput screens used in directed evolution. I am currently collaborating with scientists both in the Arnold lab and in other groups to design enzymes and light-sensitive proteins with unique properties. As science becomes more complex and data-driven, many of the interesting problems will be at the borders between disciplines, and I find that working with people with different backgrounds provides a fuller perspective on what problems are interesting and how to approach them.
