# About Me

I am currently a PhD student in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at Caltech. I work in Frances Arnold's [lab](http://cheme.che.caltech.edu/groups/fha/). Before that, I completed my undergraduate degree at The Ohio State University. Between Ohio State and graduate school, I was a Teach for American corps member teaching math and physics at a low-income high school in Inglewood, CA.

My resume can be found [here](https://github.com/yangkky/resume/blob/master/KKY_cv.pdf)

# Research Interests
Machine learning is a powerful computational tool that uses a combination of algorithms and pattern recognition to build predictions and make decisions based on experimental data. This is an inherently interdisciplinary field, seen as the cutting edge of both industry and academia. My research uses machine learning to address otherwise intractable challenges in protein engineering and design. I am currently collaborating with several groups to design enzymes and light-responsive proteins with unique capabilities.
