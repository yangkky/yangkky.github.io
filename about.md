I am currently a machine learning scientist at VL57, a Flagship Pioneering company.

From 2014-2018, I was a PhD student in Chemical Engineering at Caltech. I work in Frances Arnold's [lab](http://cheme.che.caltech.edu/groups/fha/). The Arnold lab is best known for its pioneering use of [directed evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_evolution) to create useful proteins without requiring a deep understanding of the biophysical underpinnings of protein folding and function. Recently, we've been designing new [light-sensitive proteins](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/03/09/1700269114.abstract) for applications in neuroscience and evolving an enzyme to make [carbon-silicon bonds](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/354/6315/1048.full?ijkey=mIJS6o5p4H63Y&keytype=ref&siteid=sci). We also pioneered the use of [machine learning for protein engineering](http://cheme.che.caltech.edu/groups/fha/publications/Romero_PNAS2012.pdf).

Before moving to California, I completed my undergraduate degree at The Ohio State University, where I studied chemical engineering with a minor in piano performance. Between Ohio State and graduate school, I taught math and physics for three years at a high school in Inglewood, California through Teach for America. In those three years, I transformed from a struggling first-year teacher into an effective instructor and robotics coach with the help of the amazing staff at Animo Inglewood Charter High School and Green Dot Public Schools. In June 2017, I had the honor of watching my last class of freshmen graduate from high school, and I'm excited to see what they do with their futures.

Outside of work, I enjoy board games, ultimate, and music. Most of all, however, I enjoy spending time with my wonderful wife and son.
