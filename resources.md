### Machine learning for proteins

| Title      | Description |
| :----------- | :----------- |
| [Machine learning-guided directed evolution for protein engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.10775)      | A review covering ML for protein engineering, including an overview of methods, two case studies, and future outlook.      |
| [Papers on machine learning for proteins](https://github.com/yangkky/Machine-learning-for-proteins)   | A github repository listing papers on machine learning for proteins.         |

### General statistics and machine learning

| Title      | Description |
| :----------- | :----------- |
| [Distribution explorer](http://bois.caltech.edu/distribution_explorer/)      |  A tool to explore commonly-used probability distributions, including information about the stories behind them. |
| [Gaussian processes for machine learning](http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/chapters/)   | Textbook on Gaussian processes         |
|[Beta and Alpha](https://betanalpha.github.io/writing/)|Michael Betancourt's many excellent tutorials on probabilistic computing and Bayesian statistics.|
|[Visual exploration of GPs](https://distill.pub/2019/visual-exploration-gaussian-processes/)|A visual tutorial on GPs that provides good intuition for their behavior. |

I also really like Sam Finlayson's [list](https://sgfin.github.io/learning-resources/#bayesML) of ML resources.
