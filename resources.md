### Machine learning for proteins

| Title      | Description |
| :----------- | :----------- |
| [Machine learning-guided directed evolution for protein engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.10775)      | A review covering ML for protein engineering, including an overview of methods, two case studies, and future outlook.      |
| [Papers on machine learning for proteins](https://github.com/yangkky/Machine-learning-for-proteins)   | A github repository listing papers on machine learning for proteins.         |

### General machine learning

I really like Sam Finlayson's [list](https://sgfin.github.io/learning-resources/#bayesML) of ML resources.
